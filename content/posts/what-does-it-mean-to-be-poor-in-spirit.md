> Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. - Matthew 5:3

This is painful to say, but…being poor in spirit is not a character trait that is popular to modern people.

Our culture tells us we must be self-confident. We must be sure of ourselves. We must be strong and depend on no one, even our spouses. The personal development market is full of books and blogs about this!

Even the modern church doesn’t always value being “poor in spirit”. We value motivational speakers and dynamic personalities, but not the “poor in spirit.”

But Jesus taught that this was essential to being a growing Christian, because he listed it first in his description of what it means to be a Christian.

But what does it mean?

## What it means to be Poor in Spirit:

The late welsh preacher Martin Lloyd Jones is super helpful! He says that:

> “To be poor in spirit means… a complete absence of pride, self-assurance, self-reliance. A consciousness that we are nothing in the presence of God… a tremendous awareness of our utter nothingness as we come face-to-face with God.”

In plain English, that means that the “poor in spirit” are humble.

Here’s another analogy:

In the same way that the economically poor do not have many resources to offer, thought they may work hard for them, the Spiritually poor realize that they don’t have anything to offer to God. They realize that all the good things in their life comes from God and they have nothing to brag about.

### A Quick Self-assessment

How do I know concretely when you are being poor in spirit or not?

Answer these quick questions...

Have I ever bragged about:

* My paycheck?
* My bank account figures?
* What school I graduated from?
* How much education I have?
* My talents, IQ?
* How laid back i am? How passionate I am?
* My nationality?
* My baptism?
* My church upbringing?
* Being busy with church activities?

John McArthur goes so far as to say that we shouldn’t even assume we are part of God’s kingdom if we are busy in church activities.

If you've answered yes to any of these questions, consider praying and asking God to rid you of any bragging attitude.

### A Tip for Social Media

Social Media is a place where it's pretty acceptable to brag about your accomplishments.

LinkedIn. Twitter. Facebook Feeds.

You may want to look over these and consider if you are coming off boastful and proud.

It's one thing to share accomplishments with friends. It's another to treat those accomplishments as things that define you or make you better.

The truly humble person is comfortable in the background, not the spotlight.

### A Prayer

_Lord, how often I boast about what does not matter - my natural abilities, personality type, moral behavior… How silly to boast about things that I had no control over._

_Empty me of self-confidence, pride, self-reliance, and the appearance of humility. Rather, fill me with the knowledge that I am nothing before you. Let me say as Jesus says “ I can do nothing of myself.”_
