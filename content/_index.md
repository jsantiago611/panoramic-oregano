    Welcome to ScriptureSavvy, an inquiry into what it means to become more like Jesus
    in our modern digital age. Iâ€™m Jon, and I believe that any Christian _can_ become
    more like Jesus by studying what the Bible says about Spiritual Formation and
    developing life-changing habits. Scripture Savvy is all about empowering Christians
    to be their best by providing practical tips, techniques, and ideas for applying
    the Scriptures to your digital life."
